Code Overview
The project uses a functional React component (App1) that leverages the useState and useEffect hooks:

State Management: The time is stored as an object containing hours, minutes, seconds, and the AM/PM session.
Effect Hook: An interval is set up in the useEffect hook to update the time every second.
Display: The time and session are displayed side by side with simple inline styling, making it easy to modify the appearance.
Customization
Styling: You can update the inline styles or integrate your own CSS for a different look.
Additional Features: Feel free to extend the functionality by adding features such as date display, timezone support, or custom animations.
